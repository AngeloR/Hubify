Hubify all your social interactions in one place
================================================
Hubify (http://hubify.ca) is a new way to interact with others. Rather than spending time looking through various websites that you belong to, Hubify does it for you. It provides you a real-time stream of all your information that you can browse at will. Browsing through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Buzz is a hassle. Why waste your time when you can make your information come to you.


Why are you on GitHub?
----------------------
A big concern for people is linking their accounts (like Facebook or Twitter) to other websites. And it's a very valid concern. Your profiles on social websites say a lot about you, and you don't want just anyone accessing them. For that reason, Hubify is on GitHub. Hubify doesn't collect your information, we don't harass your friends... in fact, we don't store any of your data on our servers unless you explictly tell us to. If you think that we're doing something shifty, take a look at our source for yourself! In fact, you can go ahead and download your own copy to run locally, just amke sure that you keep it up to date to take advantage of all the new features we add. 


Version 0.0.1
-------------
Supports: 	Facebook (modest)


Planned Version 0.0.2
---------------------
Supports: 	Facebook (full)
			Twitter (modest)
			
			
What's Modest and full?
-----------------------
When we add new social media networks (called modules) to Hubify we start out by providing a modest interface. This is a version of the interface and features that we are planning to support. All the features visible may not work. For example, at version 0.0.1 (alpha launch) we provide a "modest facebook interface". This interface had a comment box that didn't quite work. By the second alpha version (0.0.2) we will have a "full facebook interface" and a "modest twitter interface". 

By having a full interface, it doesn't mean that things won't change, it just means that everything that you can currently see works! You may run into the occasional bug, but all-in-all things should be just fine! Incase you DO run into a bug, however, report it either at GitHub (if you're using a local copy) or at http://hubify.lighthouseapp.com if you are using the web interface.
